# WordEmbeddings
The python scripts I used to prepare files to be processed in Nomic AI and bert Word Vectors like BERT


There are 7 txt files:
Herodotus, Histories
Cicero, On The Republic
Livy, Ab Urbe Condita Libri, History of Rome
Pliny the Elder, Natural History
Strabo, Geographica 
Plutarchâ€™s Parallel Lives
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities

Embarassingly these are English translations, I meant to have versions of the original languages, but I wanted to optimize my process first.

Allplaces.csv, and allplacesshorter.csv, is a compiled list of ancient roman sites from the Romurbital and Pleiades archive.  The Pleiades archive is too big, so I removed it, leaving onlya few words in that column, but still keeping all sites listed in the Romurbital.

These files are meant to be used by the 'listwordsfortagging.py"

#listwordsfortagging.py

This script has a database of terms that I want to know if they are in the ancient historian's book or not. It looks for geographic features terminologies and for the words listed in the allplacesshorter.csv.  I hope to expand on this list in the future.

Its output is a csv file with column 1 being all the relative words found in the txt, and column 2 gives its category (Geo_feature, unidentified, Romurbital, Plieades, etc)
To use it, you need to only update file paths to the txt you want to examine, and the pathfile to allplacesshorter.csv
